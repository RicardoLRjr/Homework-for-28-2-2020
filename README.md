What is this?

This project is a refactor of the existing Horiseon website. In this refactor, I simplified the codebase
and reorganized the index.html and stle.css to better match the format of the website, among other changes.

Who worked on this?

Ricardo L Russ

Features:
Reorganization of the codebase, including replacement of generic "div" elements with semantic elements

Simplification of the style.css, so there are fewer extraneous CSS selectors

Changed title or webpage from "website" to "Horiseon: Your Leader in SEO"

Fixed all links so that they navigate to the proper content

Adding in Alt Text, to help aid in accessability of the site 

Modification of the navigation bar so that it is sequential in order.

Added comments detailing changes into the index.html
